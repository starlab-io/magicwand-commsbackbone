=========

Describe how it works. What is an APT (application to protect), how are we protecting it?
What is a mitigation? How are we impacting performance, provide a diagram or chart and compare
an actual application like Apache with and without the INS/MWCOMMS stack. How might this actually
be deployed and used in the field.
