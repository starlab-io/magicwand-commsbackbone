Development Environment
=======================

This section should describe in detail how someone would setup a system with our code and get it all running and how verify it's actually working. I would pull in our "setup" wiki contents at a bare minimum, then add information about netflow, any scripts such as the netflow library and example script, the mw_distro_ins.py script for controlling INS instances, debugging built into the code, like the debugfs or gdb, or shim logging. Point to the Makefiles where we have features commented out. This should be a very practical section, after reading this someone not familiar with the project could setup a development environment, verify everything is working as designed, make code changes to each major sub-system, compile those changes and restart the environment with those changes.
