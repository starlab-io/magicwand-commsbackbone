Artifacts / Source Code Layout
==============================

Describe where things are in the Git repository. I think this would be a useful section for
someone picking up this project/code in the future. Maybe a bulleted list of the major code
sub-sections (shim, mwcomms, ins) then give git repository pathnames and filenames. Maybe also
a general overview of how all the pieces share things like data structures, ie the common header
files. This would have been a great thing to have when I started.
