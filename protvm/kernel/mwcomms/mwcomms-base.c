 * @brief   Linux kernel module to support MagicWand comms to/from INS.
 *
 * Introduction
 * -------------
 *
 * This is the MagicWand driver (Linux kernel module, or LKM) for the
 * protected virtual machine (PVM). It facilitates the passing of
 * requests from a protected application to one or more Isolated
 * Network Stacks (INSs, currently backed by Rump unikernels on the
 * same hardware). It also facilitates the delivery of a response,
 * produced by an INS, to the protected application that expects
 * it. This LKM is intended to be exercised by a custom shared object
 * ("shim") that the protected application loads via LD_PRELOAD. The
 * shim is available in this repo.
 *
 * The LKM supports multithreading / multiprocessing - e.g a
 * multi-threaded application above it can read/write to its device,
 * and each request (write) can expect to receive the corresponding
 * response (via read). It is designed to be fast, with expected
 * slowdowns in the 10s of milliseconds relative to native speeds.
 *
 * The LKM supports a handshake with another Xen virtual machine, the
 * INS unikernel agent (implemented on the Rump unikernel). The
 * handshake involves discovering each others' domain IDs, event
 * channels, and sharing memory via grant references.
 *
 * The LKM supports the usage of an underlying Xen ring buffer. The
 * LKM writes requests to the ring buffer, and reads responses from
 * it. The LKM makes no assumptions about the ordering of responses.
 * The code that interacts with the underlying Xen ring buffer and the
 * Xen event channel is the busiest and most performance-critical part
 * of the system, and is found in mwcomms-xen-iface.c. The sending of
 * an event on the event channel wakes up a thread in the INS, which
 * then reads the next request off the ring buffer (the event
 * indicates that the request is available for consumption). Likewise,
 * the LKM has a special thread that reads responses off the ring
 * buffer(s). It blocks on a semaphore which is up()ed by the LKM's
 * event channel handler.
 *
 *
 * Multi-threading
 * ---------------
 *
 * Multithreading support works as follows:
 *
 * (1) A user-mode program writes a request to the LKM's device. The
 *     LKM assigns a driver-wide unique ID to that request and
 *     associates the caller's PID with the request ID via a
 *     connection mapping. Assume that the program indicates it will
 *     wait for a response (it is not required to wait unless it says
 *     it will do so)..
 *
 * (2) The user-mode program reads a response from the LKM. The LKM
 *     will cause that read() to block until it receives the response
 *     with an ID that matches the request's ID. As mentioned earlier,
 *     the LKM provides a kernel thread that reads responses off the
 *     ring buffer and notifies blocked threads when their respective
 *     responses have arrived. If the program had indicated that it
 *     will not wait, then the LKM destroys the response upon receipt
 *     and after some processing.
 *
 * This model implies some strict standards:
 *
 * - The remote side *must* send a response for every request it
 *   receives, although the responses can be in a different order than
 *   the requests.
 * 
 * - The programs that use this LKM must be well-written: upon writing
 *   a request, they must indicate to the LKM whether or not they will
 *   read a response. If the program says it will wait but doesn't,
 *   then the LKM will signal a completion variable and leak the
 *   response until the LKM is unloaded -- the user-provided thread
 *   was supposed to consume the response and destroy it.  The moral
 *   of the story is that the user-mode shim should be correct.
 *
 *
 * Leveraging the Linux kernel's VFS
 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * The first iteration of this driver did not leverage the VFS: it
 * presented the shim with pseudo-file objects. This model was mostly
 * adequate until the system was exercised against a more advanced
 * protected application, Apache. Apache makes extensive use of
 * polling, which in turn meant that the shim and LKM had to include
 * support for MagicWand's version of polling. Moreover, there was a
 * design problem wherein the death of a protected application was not
 * always recognized by the LKM, thereby leaking resources.
 *
 * To alleviate these problems, the LKM was redesigned to leverage VFS
 * and allow the development to focus on MagicWand, rather than
 * re-implementing epoll() and release() support, which had already
 * been done by the Linux community.  With the rewrite, the LKM now
 * backs each Magic Wand socket (mwsocket) with a kernel file object
 * to enable integration with the kernel's VFS. This provides
 * important functionality that programs make use of; in particular:
 *
 * - release() allows for clean destruction of an mwsocket upon
 *   program termination,
 *
 * - poll() allows for seemless usage of select(), poll() and epoll.
 *
 * Moreover, mwsockets implement these operations, which are used by
 * the user-mode shim:
 *
 * - write() for putting a request on the ring buffer
 *
 * - read() for getting a response off the ring buffer
 *
 * - ioctl() for modifying the bahavior of an mwsocket, i.e. mimicking
 *   the functionality of setsockopt() and fcntl()
 *
 * The above benefits provided the primary motivation for creating
 * version 0.2 of the LKM. Without integration into the VFS, the shim
 * has to intercept and translate every poll-related call, including
 * the complex epoll structures.
 *
 * This LKM is structured such that this object, mwcomms-base, serves
 * as the main entry point. It initializes its own kernel device and
 * initializes the Xen subsystem and the netflow channel.
 *
 * When initializing the Xen subsystem, a callback is passed to
 * it. When a new INS is recognized, the subsystem completes a
 * handshake with it to include sharing a block of memory for a ring
 * buffer. Once that is complete, the callback is invoked. That, in
 * turn, notifies the mwsocket subsystem that there is a new INS
 * available for usage. If there are any listening sockets, those will
 * be "replicated" to the new INS to facilitate multi-INS
 * support. N.B. a new INS is recognized on a XenWatch thread, which
 * we cannot cause to block for a long time. Thus the mwsocket
 * subsystem completes socket replication via a work item.
 *
 * When a process wants to create a new mwsocket, it sends an IOCTL to
 * the main LKM device. That causes mwcomms-socket to create a new
 * mwsocket, backed by a file object, in the calling process, and
 * return the mwsocket's new file descriptor. Thereafter the process
 * interacts with that file descriptor to perform IO on the
 * mwsocket. Closing the file descriptor will cause the release()
 * callback in mwcomms-socket to be invoked, thus destroying the
 * mwsocket.
 *
 * The core functionality of this LKM is found in mwcomms-socket.
 *
 *
 * Here's a visualization of the LKM:
 *
 *                              Application-initiated request
 *                              -----------------------------
 *  /dev/mwcomms
 *  +----------+
 *  | open     | <--------------- Init: open /dev/mwcomms
 *  +----------+
 *  | release  | <--------------- Shutdown: close /dev/mwcomms
 *  +----------+
 *  | ioctl    | <--------------- Check whether FD is for mwsocket, or
 *  +----------+                   create new mwsocket
 *       |
 *       +----------------------------+
 *                 (new mwsocket)     |
 *                                    |
 *                                    |
 * Application-initiated              |         Application/Kernel-initiated
 * ---------------------              v         ----------------------------
 *                                 mwsocket
 *                                +---------+
 * send request --------------->  | write   |
 *                                +---------+
 * get response for request --->  | read    |
 *                                +---------+
 * modify mwsocket behavior --->  | ioctl   |
 *                                +---------+
 *                                | poll    | <------ select/poll/epoll
 *                                +---------+
 *                                | release | <------ close last ref to underlying 
 *                                +---------+          file object
 *
 * The significant advantages to this design can be seen in the
 * diagram: the kernel facilities are leveraged to support (1) polling
 * and (2) mwsocket destruction, even in the case of process
 * termination. This alleviates the LKM from those burdens. In a
 * future refactor, this could be simplified so that the mwsocket
 * object uses the main device's functions. In this case, a socket()
 * call would result in a direct opening of /dev/mwcomms for a new
 * file descriptor.
 *
 *
 * Multi-INS support
 * -----------------
 *
 * To facilitate attack mitigation and TCP/IP stack diversification,
 * the driver supports multiple INSs. This feature is considered in
 * beta; there are still some issues to work out.
 *
 * The driver does not create new INSs, nor does it direct that to
 * happen. The INSs publish network traffic statistics to XenStore. An
 * external agent (such as mw_distro_ins.py, in the repo) fulfills the
 * task of creating INSs and deciding which INS to use for inbound
 * connections. In turn, the LKM recognizes the appearance of a new
 * INS and completes a handshake with it. Upon a successful handshake,
 * the INS is registered and is considered available for requests.
 *
 * Once a new INS is registered, any listening sockets must be
 * "replicated" onto it. For instance, say a protected application has
 * requested to listen on 0.0.0.0:80, and INS 1 is doing that on its
 * TCP/IP stack. Then INS 2 appears. To enable multiplexing of the
 * protected application, INS 2 must also listen on that port. The LKM
 * is responsible for telling INS 2 to listen on port 80. It achieves
 * this by creating a work item that crafts the requests (from within
 * the kernel) and sends them to the new INS. It does this via work
 * item because it cannot block the XenStore watching thread.
 *
 * This behavior means that when an inbound connection on port 80
 * could come from any known INS. The LKM must direct that connection
 * (a response to an accept) to the thread that originally wrote the
 * accept request, although it may have sent it to a different INS (or
 * set of INSs). The LKM achieves this capability by maintaining a
 * list of inbound connections for each mwsocket. Upon an inbound
 * connection, the response is put in the list and a special semaphore
 * is up()-ed, which the accept()ing thread is blocking on. Moreover,
 * each "replicated" mwsocket has an associated "primary" mwsocket,
 * which is the one exposed to the user.
