The test harness orchestrates Apache, GoLoris, and a set of monitoring streams to generate performance and trace data for use
in building the models backing MagicWand, and verifying the models, and testing mitigations. These directions assume you are
in a working Docker environment.

Once the test harness has been run, the generated performance, trace, and log data can be processed, archived, and visualized.

Sample of the visualization:
