The rumprun software stack is provided under a 2-clause BSD license
which is given at the end of this file.

NetBSD source code (src-netbsd) is required for successful execution.
NetBSD is licensed under a BSD style license, but third party code
imported into the NetBSD tree's "external" section may have a differing
license.  For example, source code licensed under CDDL is found in
src/external/cddl.  Almost all of the produced rump kernel component
binaries fall under a BSD license, but when pertinent, verify the license
of a component by examining its source code.  We do not intentionally
include code which is available exclusively under GPL to avoid debate
on the licensing terms of the entire rumprun stack.
