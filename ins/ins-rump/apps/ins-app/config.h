// Max number of threads. This is the same as the max number of
// concurrent connections we can handle. Under normal circumstances,
// most of them will be in a wait state most of the time - so a large
// number should be OK. However, Rump seems to have an internal limit
// of 100, although we have problems when we exceed 62 worker threads
// (plus some extra that do other things). Exceeding the max causes
// open to fail with EMFILE errno.
//
// Must be >= 2 to function.  Values < 25 result in significant
// performance degradation.
